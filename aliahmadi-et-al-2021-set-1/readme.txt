The format of data is as follows:


The first line contains the following information about nodes:

n	m	k						

where
	n = Number of depots 

	m = Number of bins 

	k = Number of intermediate facilities 



The next line contain the following information for each day:  

p	q	w

where
        p = Number of trucks 

	q = Number of trailers

	w = Number of time windwos per day



And the next lines contain the following information:  


dis: Distance between nodes i,j(depots, bins,intermediate facilities).
LN: The number of traffic light between nodes i,j .
ET: Exiting time of the vehicle v.
---------------
R:  An uncertain amount of MSW in node i and TW s.
---------------
MT: The maximum trip time allowed for the vehicle v.
NV: The maximum available number of vehicle v .
---------------
V: variable cost of the vehicle v (trucks and trailers) for travelling per unit distance.
F: Fixed cost of the vehicle v per unit time.
---------------
CV: The maximum capacity allowed for the vehicle v.
Cf: The maximum capacity allowed for the intermediate facility.
---------------
LT: The lower bound of HTW at the TW s.
UT: The upper bound of HTW at the TW s.
---------------
S: The average speed of the vehicle v.
wt: The average waiting time of a vehicle at the traffic light.
lut:The average load/ unload time of a vehicle.
